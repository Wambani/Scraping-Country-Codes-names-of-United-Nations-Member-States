# Website scraping and data cleaning with python
Decided to do a quick web scraping with python.
Used urllib.request and Beautiful soup to scrap the website page: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/iso3list/en/ and cleaned and structured the data with pandas 
The objective was to learn and practice what I had already learned
